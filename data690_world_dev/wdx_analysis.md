Indicators - Electrical power consumption (kWh per capita) and electricity produced from oil, gas and coal sources (% of total)

# Introduction - 
To maintain economic growth, enhance living standards, and end poverty, the global economy needs an ever-increasing amount of energy. But current energy use patterns cannot continue. Nonrenewable energy sources will get riskier and more expensive as the world population rises and nations become more industrialized.

# Electrical power consumption (kWh per capita)
USA, UK, India and China are among the top 10 countries with highest GDP in 2022. Interestingly China, India and United states are the three most populous countries in the world with UK being the 21st country in terms of population. Despite the fact that these countries have vastly different populations, their electricity usage is not the same.The United States consumes more than 13 times as much electricity as India does. Of the four nations, the United States consumes the most power, whereas India uses the least.

Although India and China are the two most populous countries in the world, the consumption of electricity by these countries is very less compared to the third most populous country that is USA. USA uses the most electricity among all these countries. UK consumes about 25kWh more electricity than India and China despite it being the 21st populates country in the world. 

# Production of electricity
Although each of these nations has different needs and capacities for producing power for its citizens, each has done so in a variety of ways. Let's examine the three distinct ways that each of these nations produces power in more detail. Natural gas, oil and coal sources. 

# Electricity produced from natural gas sources (% of total)
Due to its various economic and environmental benefits, natural gas has lately replaced coal as the main fossil fuel for the production of power. Coal and nuclear power plants dominated energy production in the 1970s and 1980s, but a shift to gas and gas plants has been pushed by a combination of economic, environmental, and technological factors.

China produces the least amount of electricity from natural gas sources among the four countries with about 1.8% of the total electricity. The production of electricity from natural gas sources by India however decreased over the past few years when compared to 2010 from over 11.5% to 4.9%. UK used to the largest producer of electricity in 2010 but the production decreased over the past few years. However the production of USA remained the same over years.  

# Electricity produced from oil sources-

India produces the most amount of electricity from oil sources. About half of the electricity(47%) produced by India is from oil sources. China produces the least amount of electricity from oil sources (6.7% of total). About 21% of the electricity produced by United States comes from Oil sources. About 1/4th of the electricity produced by United Kingdom comes from oil sources. 

# Electricity produced from coal sources-

In every country, coal is used to generate electricity. According to data from the IEA, coal-fired power plants will continue to produce 22% of the world's electricity in 2040, keeping coal as the single greatest source of electricity globally. Coal-fired power plants currently provide 37% of the world's electricity. For the generation of power, all four of these nations rely on coal, which is also the most polluting because it emits more CO2 and other dangerous gases.

Among these four countries, China produces the most electricity from coal. About 3/4th of the electricity consumed by China comes from coal. Next most production of electricity from coal is by India. India produces about 67% of its electricity from coal. United Kingdom is the least producer of electricity from coal with about 1/4th of the electricity coming from coal. USA produces nearly half of its electricity from coal. The major source of electricity from all these nations comes from coal.  

# Electricity produced from oil, gas and coal sources (% of total)

In 2015, coal, oil, and gas accounted for 81.2 percent of the electricity produced in India, compared to 79.4 percent in China, 70.27 percent in the US, and 70 percent in UK. 
All four of these countries produce most of its electricity from oil, gas and coal sources. 


In conclusion, the amount of power generated and used in a country is inversely proportional to the amount of pollution it produces. We can see that a nation pollutes more the more it depends on fossil fuels to meet its energy demands. Making the transition to renewable energy sources for energy production is the simplest way to handle this. They too experience challenges with initial investment and other limitations. Even if nuclear power is a feasible option, it is expensive and difficult for any government to maintain, especially in developing nations. The challenges posed by fossil fuel extraction and the ensuing pollution are a reality that need attention.
