Indicators - Electrical power consumption (kWh per capita) and electricity produced from oil, gas and coal sources (% of total)

# Introduction - 
To maintain economic growth, enhance living standards, and end poverty, the global economy needs an ever-increasing amount of energy. But current energy use patterns cannot continue. Nonrenewable energy sources will get riskier and more expensive as the world population rises and nations become more industrialized.

# Electrical power consumption (kWh per capita)
USA, UK, India and China are among the top 10 countries with highest GDP in 2022. Interestingly China, India and United states are the three most populous countries in the world with UK being the 21st country in terms of population. Despite the fact that these countries have vastly different populations, their electricity usage is not the same.The United States consumes more than 13 times as much electricity as India does. Of the four nations, the United States consumes the most power, whereas India uses the least.

Although India and China are the two most populous countries in the world, the consumption of electricity by these countries is very less compared to the third most populous country that is USA. USA uses the most electricity among all these countries. UK consumes about 25kWh more electricity than India and China despite it being the 21st populates country in the world. 

# Production of electricity
Although each of these nations has different needs and capacities for producing power for its citizens, each has done so in a variety of ways. Let's examine the three distinct ways that each of these nations produces power in more detail. Natural gas, oil and coal sources. 

# Electricity produced from natural gas sources (% of total)
Due to its various economic and environmental benefits, natural gas has lately replaced coal as the main fossil fuel for the production of power. Coal and nuclear power plants dominated energy production in the 1970s and 1980s, but a shift to gas and gas plants has been pushed by a combination of economic, environmental, and technological factors.

China produces the least amount of electricity from natural gas sources among the four countries with about 1.8% of the total electricity. The production of electricity from natural gas sources by India however decreased over the past few years when compared to 2010 from over 11.5% to 4.9%. UK used to the largest producer of electricity in 2010 but the production decreased over the past few years. However the production of USA remained the same over years.  

# Electricity produced from oil sources-

India produces the most amount of electricity from oil sources. About half of the electricity(47%) produced by India is from oil sources. China produces the least amount of electricity from oil sources (6.7% of total). About 21% of the electricity produced by United States comes from Oil sources. About 1/4th of the electricity produced by United Kingdom comes from oil sources.
